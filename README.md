# spacemacs-config
This is a copy of my spacemacs configuration that I use for development, book keeping, notes, organization etc. I hope this can be of use to you. In case of any issues, please feel free to reach out to me, raise an issue or create a pull request.

# Why Spacemacs?
Original documentation can be found at the [Spacemacs github repo](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). For me it provides a perfect combination of power and beauty.

# Installing Configuration
While you might not be interested in installing this directly, but rather use certain parts of the configuration package. Direct installation can be done with the following steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt, paste the following code to it:

`git clone https://github.com/love2dishtech/spacemacs-config ~/.emacs.d`

Press enter to execute the code and the program you installed in the previous step, Git, will download the Spacemacs extension files.

Additionally, following [fonts](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro#font-installation-instructions) are recommended to be installed for Spacemacs.

You can find the complete spacemacs installation instruction [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.org)
